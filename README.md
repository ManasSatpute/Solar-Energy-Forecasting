# Solar-Energy-Forecasting
The project is based on analyzing the dataset for a given period of a solar power plant and then predicting 
the power generation in the coming days. A Machine Learning model is made in such a way that it predicts the 
power generated by a single solar panel. Along with counting the prediction , it is also able to detect a 
faulty panel or if it needs maintenance
