Solar Energy Forecasting as the name suggests is an application that allows us to predict the amount of Solar Energy.
The main motive of this project is to analyse the dataset of a given solar power plant and then predicting the power generation for the coming days. A Machine Learning 
model is made in such a way that it predicts the power generated by the solar panels. Apart from the prediction, it is also able to detect a faulty panel that needs maintenance.
Since the main focus was to analyse the data I have not yet made the front end of the project and focused entirely upon the backend which is done using Jupyter notebooks on 
Google Colab.
There were 3 phases to this project â€“ 
1-	Data Cleaning and Processing
2-	Most important ML phase
3-	Visualisation and analysing
Data Cleaning and processing was mostly done using Pandas but keeping that aside I would like to talk about the main ML phase which was implemented using Prophet model.
Prophet is a procedure for forecasting time series data based on an additive model where non-linear trends are fit with yearly, weekly, and daily seasonality.
Then coming to the last phase -  visualisation. It was mostly done using the inbuilt Plot function. The visualised charts and graphs could be analysed to predict as 
well as identify sub-obtimally performing panels.
